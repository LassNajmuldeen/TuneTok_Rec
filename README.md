# TuneTok

A music feed application built with React and TypeScript, inspired by TikTok's website and made for Spotify's music app. The application allows users to like, comment, and interact with music videos, featuring a feed that displays various songs. It provides basic user interactions such as liking videos and adding comments.

## Features

- **Music Feed**: Display a list of music tracks with a playable audio player.
- **Like/Unlike Videos**: Users can like or unlike a video, updating the like count.
- **Comment Section**: Users can add comments to videos and react to comments with likes/dislikes.
- **Basic UI/UX**: Designed to resemble the look and feel of Spotify.

## Future Enhancements

This project will eventually integrate an advanced **recommendation system** based on **cosine similarity** to personalize the feed. The system will analyze user preferences and interactions to suggest content that aligns with their interests. This feature is aimed at enhancing the user experience by tailoring the content they see.
